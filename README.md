#Project Description

Since its inception in 2008, Airbnb has disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more travellers decide to use Airbnb as their primary means of accommodation. Airbnb offers travellers a more unique and personalized way of accommodation and experience.

As of October 2020, this dataset contains nearly 226029 Airbnb listings in U.S. The purpose of this task is to predict the price of U.S. Airbnb rentals based on the data provided and any external dataset(s) with relevant information. 
The detail information it includes are features such as host id, host name, listing id, listing name, latitude and longitude of listing, the neighborhood, price, room type, minimum number of nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per month, availability, hot listings and city.

My goal is predicting the price of U.S. AirBnB rentals.
Also find out the best performing model for predicting price.
